Task 2 qanda
1. What filter did you use for Task 2.1?

http && ip.addr == 138.197.192.78

2. Perform your own capture of HTTP traffic to my website.
Make sure you use http:// and not https://.
Isolate the relevant packets (may be more/less than 24, as long as they are relevant).
Submit that capture as L03-my-http-capture.pcapng.

Done. Capture saved in zip folder.

3. How many HTTP 404 error responses are in the entire capture file? What filter will filter http response codes that equal 404?

There is 1 HTTP 404 error in the capture file.
http.response.code == 404 

4. Looking at frame number 18689, is it an HTTP request or response? If it is a request, what frame number contains the response? If it is a response, what frame number contains the request?

Looking at frame number 18689 it is a HTTP request. The frame number that contains the response is 18693 with ACK.


5. Are multiple TCP connections (sockets) used for the GET requests/responses for scrivnor.cikeys.com? How can we verify that?

There are multiple TCP connections used for the get request/responses. I counted a total of 6, and the way I verified that was using filters on wireshark.
ip.addr == 138.197.192.78 && tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 1

6. (Extra Credit) Another website was accessed via HTTP, what what was it and how did you figure it out?

There were other websites that were accessed via HTTP. The websites that were accessed and captured were amazontrust.com, godaddy.com, digicert.com, lxer.com.
I was able to grab this data by adding a filter to http.host, Then went to Statistics tab, then HTTP drop down, then Load Distribution option. From there I am able to re enter the filter http.host, and under HTTP Request by server dropdown, then HTTP Requests by HTTP Host, I am able to access the list of websites that were accessed on the wireshark capture.
